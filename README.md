# Covid-19-Data-Analysis & visualization With Plotly Express

## Overview
This project explores the global trends of COVID-19 cases using **Python, Pandas, and Plotly Express**.  
The dataset is stored in the `data/` folder, and all analysis steps are implemented in the Colab notebook `covid_analysis.ipynb`.

The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and create **interactive visualizations** (line plots, bar charts, choropleth maps, bubble charts) to better understand the spread and impact of the pandemic.

- `data/` → contains the COVID-19 datasets (Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered cases).  
- `covid_analysis.ipynb` → main notebook with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.  
- `README.md` → project documentation.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – for data wrangling and preprocessing  
- **Plotly Express** – for interactive charts and maps  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – for static plots  
- **Google Colab** – for implementation

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning & Wrangling of COVID-19 case records  
- Interactive visualizations with Plotly Express:
  - **Line Charts** → Trend of cases over time  
  - **Bar Charts** → Comparison across countries  
  - **Bubble Charts** → Relation between testing and cases  
  - **Choropleth Maps** → Country-wise spread of COVID-19
